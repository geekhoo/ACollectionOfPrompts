# DevExtreme jQuery dist

This folder bundles the files generated by `pnpx nx run devextreme:build-dist` plus the compiled themes so that a coding agent can immediately build static HTML/CSS/JS pages with DevExtreme jQuery widgets without relying on npm.

## Layout
- `css/` — `dx.common.css`, every prebuilt theme (`dx.light.css`, `dx.material.*.css`, *etc.*) plus the `fonts/` and `icons/` directories that those stylesheets depend on.
- `js/` — the bundles (`dx.all.js`, `dx.all.debug.js`, `dx.ai-integration.js`, `dx.aspnet.*`, `FileSaver(.min).js`), localization assets under `js/localization`, and the vectormap support directories that `dxMap` requires.
- `prompts/` — Markdown files per widget (e.g., `dxDataGrid.md`) describing how to instantiate the component with these assets.

## Quick start for a coding agent
1. Reference the DevExtreme styling before any markup:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/dx.common.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/dx.light.css">
   ```
   Keep the `css/fonts` and `css/icons` folders alongside those stylesheets so the built-in icon/font paths remain valid.
2. Include a compatible jQuery build (3.7.x is recommended) before loading DevExtreme:
   ```html
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.0.min.js"></script>
   <script src="js/dx.all.js"></script>
   ```
3. Use the widgets as jQuery plugins (`$('#target').dxDataGrid({...})`). Use `dx.all.debug.js` only when you need readable sources.
4. If you need locales other than English, insert the matching `js/localization/<locale>.js` before `dx.all.js`.
5. Export helpers (`FileSaver.js`) and specialized bundles (`dx.ai-integration.js`, `dx.aspnet.*`) are already copied for reference; include them as needed without changing namespaces.

## Component prompts
Check `prompts/<component>.md` for sample markup/initialization steps for every widget. Each prompt looks for the shared `css/` and `js/` assets described above.

## Notes
- Relative paths inside the HTML snippets assume your page is adjacent to this folder; adjust `../` as necessary if you move the directory.
- The vectormap subfolders under `js/` keep the map data separate so caching agents can reuse them without extra downloads.
